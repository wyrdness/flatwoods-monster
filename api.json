      "full": "The Flatwoods Monster, also known as the Braxton County Monster, is an entity reportedly encountered on September 12, 1952, in Flatwoods, West Virginia. The encounter began when local boys witnessed a bright object cross the sky and apparently land on the property of local farmer G. Bailey Fisher. A group including Kathleen May, her two sons, their friend Gene Lemon (a National Guardsman), and several other boys went to investigate. They reported encountering a 10-12 foot tall figure with a spade-shaped head, glowing red face, and a dark metallic body that appeared to hover or float. The entity allegedly emitted a hissing sound and released a mist that caused nausea and breathing difficulties in the witnesses. The incident was investigated by journalist Gray Barker and gained national attention, becoming one of the most famous UFO-related entity encounters of the 1950s. Skeptical explanations suggest the witnesses may have encountered a barn owl perched on a tree branch, with the 'UFO' being a meteor, though this explanation remains disputed."
