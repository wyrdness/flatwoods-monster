      "full": "The Flatwoods Monster, also known as the Braxton County Monster, is an entity reportedly encountered on September 12, 1952, in Flatwoods, West Virginia. The encounter began when local boys witnessed a bright object cross the sky and apparently land on the property of local farmer G. Bailey Fisher. A group including Kathleen May, her two sons, their friend Gene Lemon (a National Guardsman), and several other boys went to investigate. They reported encountering a 10-12 foot tall figure with a spade-shaped head, glowing red face, and a dark metallic body that appeared to hover or float. The entity allegedly emitted a hissing sound and released a mist that caused nausea and breathing difficulties in the witnesses. The incident was investigated by journalist Gray Barker and gained national attention. Skeptical explanations suggest the witnesses may have encountered a barn owl perched on a tree branch, with the 'UFO' being a meteor, though this explanation remains disputed."

They enlisted Kathleen May (the boys' mother), local National Guardsman Eugene 'Gene' Lemon, and brothers Neil Nunley and Ronnie Shaver to investigate. As the group climbed the hill, they reported a pungent mist that caused breathing difficulties and nausea. Gene Lemon's dog ran ahead and began barking, then came running back in apparent fear. The group encountered a large pulsating ball of fire. When Lemon shone his flashlight toward a nearby oak tree, they saw a 10-12 foot tall figure with a spade-shaped head, glowing red face, and dark metallic body that appeared to hover. The entity emitted a hissing sound. Terrified, the group fled. Several witnesses became ill afterward, experiencing symptoms including vomiting, convulsions, and irritated throats. Local sheriff Robert Carr and deputy Burnell Long investigated the site later that night, finding skid marks and an area of flattened grass with a strange odor, but no entity.",
