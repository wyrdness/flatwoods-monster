## Notes on Gray Barker

Gray Barker (1925-1984) was the primary investigator of the Flatwoods case and a significant figure in 1950s-60s UFO research. However, researchers should note that Barker is known to have embellished and potentially fabricated details in some of his cases. His work should be evaluated critically while still being recognized as the primary contemporary documentation of the Flatwoods incident.
