## Overview

The Flatwoods Monster, also known as the Braxton County Monster, is an entity reportedly encountered on September 12, 1952, in Flatwoods, West Virginia. The encounter began when local boys witnessed a bright object cross the sky and apparently land on the property of local farmer G. Bailey Fisher.

A group including Kathleen May, her two sons, their friend Gene Lemon (a National Guardsman), and several other boys went to investigate. They reported encountering a 10-12 foot tall figure with a spade-shaped head, glowing red face, and a dark metallic body that appeared to hover or float. The entity allegedly emitted a hissing sound and released a mist that caused nausea and breathing difficulties in the witnesses.

The incident was investigated by journalist Gray Barker and gained national attention, becoming one of the most famous UFO-related entity encounters of the 1950s. Skeptical explanations suggest the witnesses may have encountered a barn owl perched on a tree branch, with the 'UFO' being a meteor, though this explanation remains disputed.

## The Flatwoods Encounter (1952) ⭐

> **Date**: September 12, 1952
> **Location**: G. Bailey Fisher farm, Flatwoods, Braxton County, West Virginia
> **Witnesses**: 7 (Kathleen May, Eugene Lemon, Edward May, Fred May, Tommy Hyer, Neil Nunley, Ronnie Shaver)
> **Evidence**: Multiple witness testimony, physical effects, ground traces, contemporary documentation

### The Incident

On the evening of September 12, 1952, brothers Edward and Fred May, along with their friend Tommy Hyer, witnessed a bright object cross the sky and land on the nearby Fisher farm. They enlisted Kathleen May (the boys' mother), local National Guardsman Eugene "Gene" Lemon, and brothers Neil Nunley and Ronnie Shaver to investigate.

As the group climbed the hill, they reported a pungent mist that caused breathing difficulties and nausea. Gene Lemon's dog ran ahead and began barking, then came running back in apparent fear.

The group encountered a large pulsating ball of fire. When Lemon shone his flashlight toward a nearby oak tree, they saw a 10-12 foot tall figure with a spade-shaped head, glowing red face, and dark metallic body that appeared to hover. The entity emitted a hissing sound.

Terrified, the group fled. Several witnesses became ill afterward, experiencing symptoms including vomiting, convulsions, and irritated throats.

### Investigation

Local sheriff Robert Carr and deputy Burnell Long investigated the site later that night, finding skid marks and an area of flattened grass with a strange odor, but no entity.

Journalist and UFO researcher Gray Barker arrived the next day to investigate, documenting witness testimony and examining the site. His investigation brought national attention to the case.

### Physical Effects

Multiple witnesses experienced:
- Nausea and vomiting
- Throat irritation and swelling
- Difficulty breathing
- Convulsions (in some cases)
- Lingering effects for several days

### Credibility Assessment

**Rating**: Medium

**Supporting Factors**:
- Multiple credible witnesses including adults
- Physical symptoms experienced by witnesses
- Evidence of disturbance at site
- Contemporary documentation
- Consistent witness accounts over decades

**Skeptical Factors**:
- Possible misidentification of barn owl and meteor
- Panic and poor lighting conditions
- Gray Barker known for embellishment in UFO cases
- No photographs despite national attention

**Notes**: One of most documented UFO entity encounters of 1950s. Witnesses maintained consistent accounts throughout their lives. Physical symptoms suggest genuine frightening experience, whether entity was extraterrestrial, misidentified animal, or misperception.

## Theories & Explanations

### Extraterrestrial Theories

1. **Alien Entity**
   Entity was extraterrestrial being associated with UFO landing. Proponents cite preceding UFO sighting, metallic appearance, hovering ability, and physical effects on witnesses.

2. **Alien Reconnaissance**
   Entity was extraterrestrial scout or robotic probe from crashed or landed craft, possibly mechanical in nature.

### Skeptical Explanations

1. **Barn Owl Misidentification** (Joe Nickell)
   Witnesses encountered a barn owl perched on tree branch, with meteor sighting creating UFO expectation. Evidence cited:
   - Barn owl heart-shaped face resembles "spade shape"
   - Owls can appear large and intimidating at night
   - Eyes reflect red in flashlight beams
   - Hissing is defensive owl behavior
   - Meteor seen region-wide that evening

2. **Mass Hysteria**
   Initial meteor sighting combined with fear, darkness, and expectation created shared misperception. Physical symptoms consistent with extreme fear response. 1950s UFO panic atmosphere contributed to interpretation.

3. **Embellishment**
   Initial encounter with mundane object or animal embellished by witnesses and investigators, particularly Gray Barker who was known for embellishing UFO cases.
